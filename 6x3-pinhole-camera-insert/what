so a while ago notbenh built a 6x3 pinhole. I would like to still keep the little box as the outside but the insert would be nice to make in plastic, it would save a bunch of time. 

TODO: 
- build model

MATERIALS:
- black PLA (one source of PLA http://ultimachine.com/catalog/print-materials/pla/pla-175mm )
